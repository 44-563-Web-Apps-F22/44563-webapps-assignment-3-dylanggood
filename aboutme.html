        <p>One interesting fact about me is that I am an Elden Lord. Not many people know what Elden Lord is, but it is
            quite the accoomplishment. I have defeated all of the shardbearers including Starscourge Radahan, and taken their 
            great runes. With all of these great runes, I was able to restore the Elden Ring and take my throne.</p>

        <p>I enjoy sci-fi movies and Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors.</p>
